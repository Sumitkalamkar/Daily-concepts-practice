## Day 2 – Logistic Regression: Effect of Feature Scaling

### Objective
To analyze the impact of feature scaling on Logistic Regression performance.

---

### Dataset
Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset

---

### Experiments
1. Logistic Regression without feature scaling
2. Logistic Regression with StandardScaler

---

### Results
- Accuracy without scaling: ~0.96
- Accuracy with scaling: ~0.97 (more stable)

---

### Key Learning
- Logistic Regression is sensitive to feature scale
- Scaling improves optimization stability
- Gradient-based models benefit significantly from normalization

---

### Conclusion
Feature scaling is a critical preprocessing step for Logistic Regression and other gradient-based algorithms.
